## **Linux Commands**

All the commonly used Linux commands, shell scripting basics, and explanations are provided in the [**Linux.md**](./Linux.md) file. You can click the link to explore various commands such as:
- `pwd`, `date`, `mkdir`, `ls`, `cat`, `rm`, and more.
- Shell scripting basics like `echo`, `read`, `exit`.

## **C Programs**

Below are the links to the C programs implementing different Page Replacement algorithms. Click on the links to view the full code:

### **Page Replacement - FIFO**
[Program 1 - FIFO](./c-programs/first-in-first-out.c)  
This program implements the **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** page replacement algorithm. It handles page requests and replaces pages in the memory using FIFO.

### **Page Replacement - Optimal**
[Program 2 - Optimal](./c-programs/optimal.c)  
This program demonstrates the **Optimal** page replacement algorithm. It replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future.

### **Page Replacement - LRU**
[Program 3 - LRU](./c-programs/lru.c)  
This program simulates the **Least Recently Used (LRU)** page replacement algorithm. It replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period.
